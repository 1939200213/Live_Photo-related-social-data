# Introduction
This project focuses on exploring the unique advantages of live photos as a novel form of visual communication. Live photos capture 1.5 seconds of dynamic footage before and after the main image, reducing the likelihood of extensive post-processing and preserving the authenticity of emotions and scenes. The concise three-second encapsulation enhances viewer immersion, making them ideal for social media platforms and innovative content creation.
